This week, we discussed the importance of role models in society. One idea we discussed was the widespread impact of "influencers". Influencers are people who are very active posting on social media and who have many followers. Influencers' posts and opinions can influence their followers' choices on everything from fashion to politics. In your opinion, do social media influencers generally have a positive or negative effect on their followers? Why do you think so?

**Amy**
I think the influencers' effect is generally positive. People can learn about the latest trends and topics in a very quick and efficient way by following influencers. In the past, people had to spend time looking through magazines or visiting boutiques to even know what was trending.

**Rory**
I think influencers generally have a negative effect because they have far too much influence. I can think of one influencer who only has to mention a particular kind of sports shoes, and the next day they'll be sold out. The followers aren't really thinking for themselves; they're just blindly following their influencers' choices.

Admittedly, social media influencers may mislead some people to act without thinking for themselves, as Rory has mentioned. Nevertheless, I think the positive effect of the influencers outweighs the negative. Social media influencers, by posting their work on social media, can introduce some new ideas or perspectives to their followers, thereby broadening the horizon of their follwers and giving them a new choice. For example, not only giving some own stands towards a certain event but also sharing some useful skills in life can be an incentive to some people, promoting a culture of  variety. However, absorbing what social media influncers say does not mean receiving their ideas without thinking. While some of their shares can be motivated, it is essential for us to implement a critical strategy towards them.
