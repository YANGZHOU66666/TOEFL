# 托福学术讨论

## 宏观结构

**选题大方向：**

1. while一个有价值（但是我不认可），同意另一个；
2. 两个观点都认可，都展开写（买东西听亲人建议还是看评论）
3. 不同情况（线下联系还是线上）
4. 另起炉灶，不写前两个学生的，产生第3个观点，感觉可以在第一句话提一下(although两个学生都有道理/前两个学生观点都挺好）



**大致结构：**

（可选）描述客观情况+阐述观点+1~2个理由，理由可选择全说理，或说理配例证+结尾句

## 每个模块的句子表达

### 1. [Optional] 开头描述客观情况模块

The allocation of funds by university administrators plays a crucial role in shaping the institution's future trajectory and impact. -> 开头可以说要讨论的话题的上位概念play an important role



### 2. 呈现观点模块。也可用于尾句

2.1 [观点]+[while反面重要性, 转述/解释观点]

In my view, administrators should prioritize investments that foster inclusivity and accessibility for all students. While enhancing infrastructure and amenities are important considerations, allocating funds towards initiatives that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion should be given top priority.



2.2 [Admittedly/Undoubtedly/Actually阐述反面重要性/正反都重要]+[Nevertheless/However，说出真正观点]

Admittedly, participating/engaging in sports is an excellent means to promote student's physical health. However, considering the university's responsibilities in promoting academic preeminence, I am inclined to prioritize the construction of a new library.



### 3. 说理模块，即说明为什么一个观点是对/错的。也可用于尾句

3.1 By...(措施), this strategy(物作主语)/ we can(人做主语)谓宾作中间逻辑, 结果作后置状语(?)

By placing a financial disincentive on driving during busy times, this approach not only reduces traffic volume but also encourages the adoption of alternative transportation modes, contributing to a more sustainable urban environment.

By prioritizing investments that promote diversity and accessibility, administrators can ensure that all students have equal opportunities to thrive and contribute to the university community, thereby enriching the overall educational experience for everyone.

3.2 关键词+状语作中间逻辑+谓宾作结果

Their insights, grounded in firsthand experiences and a deep understanding of our individual needs, can help us make choices that align with our values.



3.3 虚拟语气反证。常用于举例后的解释

(第一句话是例子)I spent hours there, soaking in the creativity, chatting with local artisans, and even trying my hand at a pottery wheel. **Had I structured my day, I would've missed that unexpected joy.**



3.4 多个理由并列排比，这样一个理由只要很少词，不难想，且可以藏一两个很水的理由在中间，但句式好看

These texts challenge our emotional depth, nurture our empathy, and broaden our understanding of diverse cultures and histories. 

使用not only等结构也是同理。事实上3.4只是个句子的修辞技巧，可以和3.1-3.3结合使用（或许可以在上面这个例子后面加一个, significantly enriching our spiritual world）



### 4. 举例模块

4.1 举实例：历史/现实中真实存在的

- Think of/Consider ... 一个短句，下一句话再详细解释

Think of the iconic Statue of Liberty in New York or the awe-inspiring frescoes in the Sistine Chapel.

- Take 对象, which或状语作描述, as an example. 下一句做解释
- For instance, 正常举例

4.2 举虚例：枚举话题的下位概念，讨论好处

For example, **investing in scholarships for underprivileged students, creating accessible facilities for students with disabilities, or implementing programs to support marginalized communities** can contribute to a more equitable and vibrant campus environment.



### 5. 措施模块。也可用于尾句
